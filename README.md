# Mini-VPN
  This is the final project in CSE644 Computer Security Spring 2018 at Syracuse University, and this course is taught by Professor Du.

  This project consists two parts, VPN server program and VPN client program. Server and client use PKI to do key exchange and VPN tunnel encryption. otherwise, the server program also supports multiple clinets, which means multiple clinets programs can connect to the server simultaneously.
